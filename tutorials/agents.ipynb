    "- [Tools](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts/#tools)\n",

    "By themselves, language models can't take actions - they just output text.\n",
    "A big use case for LangChain is creating **agents**.\n",
    "Agents are systems that use LLMs as reasoning engines to determine which actions to take and the inputs to pass them.\n",
    "After executing actions, the results can be fed back into the LLM to determine whether more actions are needed, or whether it is okay to finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will build an agent that can interact with a search engine. You will be able to ask this agent questions, watch it call the search tool, and have conversations with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## End-to-end agent\n",
    "\n",
    "The code snippet below represents a fully functional agent that uses an LLM to decide which tools to use. It is equipped with a generic search tool. It has conversational memory - meaning that it can be used as a multi-turn chatbot.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rest of the guide, we will walk through the individual components and what each part does - but if you want to just grab some code and get started, feel free to use this!"

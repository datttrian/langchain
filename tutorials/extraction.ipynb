    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide (and most of the other guides in the documentation) uses [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and assumes the reader is as well. Jupyter notebooks are perfect for learning how to work with LLM systems because oftentimes things can go wrong (unexpected output, API down, etc) and going through guides in an interactive environment is a great way to better understand them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This and other tutorials are perhaps most conveniently run in a Jupyter notebook. See [here](https://jupyter.org/install) for instructions on how to install.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "To install LangChain run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{=mdx}\n",
    "import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';\n",
    "import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';\n",
    "import CodeBlock from \"@theme/CodeBlock\";\n",
    "\n",
    "<Tabs>\n",
    "  <TabItem value=\"pip\" label=\"Pip\" default>\n",
    "    <CodeBlock language=\"bash\">pip install langchain</CodeBlock>\n",

    "  <TabItem value=\"conda\" label=\"Conda\">\n",
    "    <CodeBlock language=\"bash\">conda install langchain -c conda-forge</CodeBlock>\n",

    "### LangSmith\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls.\n",
    "As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent.\n",
    "The best way to do this is with [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "After you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=\"true\"\n",
    "export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=\"...\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, if in a notebook, you can set them with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import getpass\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "os.environ[\"LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2\"] = \"true\"\n",

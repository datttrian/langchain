    "# How to debug your LLM apps\n",
    "\n",
    "Like building any type of software, at some point you'll need to debug when building with LLMs. A model call will fail, or model output will be misformatted, or there will be some nested model calls and it won't be clear where along the way an incorrect output was created.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main methods for debugging:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Verbose Mode: This adds print statements for \"important\" events in your chain.\n",
    "- Debug Mode: This add logging statements for ALL events in your chain.\n",
    "- LangSmith Tracing: This logs events to [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) to allow for visualization there.\n",

    "Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls.\n",
    "As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent.\n",
    "The best way to do this is with [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "After you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:\n",

    "export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=\"true\"\n",
    "export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=\"...\"\n",

    "```python\n",

    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "os.environ[\"LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2\"] = \"true\"\n",

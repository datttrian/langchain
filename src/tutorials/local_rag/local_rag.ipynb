       "' The process of task decomposition can be even more challenging. Human inputs are essential in tasks with multiple subgoals that require coordination, such as creating a novel, and where the goal is to combine different pieces of information into meaningful insights.\\n\\nCase studies:\\n1) Using LLMs for planning and decomposing complex tasks like \"Write a story\" or \"Create a poem.\" in video games. For example, Google\\'s T5 model was used to plan and generate storylines for the game \"Minecraft Story Mode.\" In this task, the model uses a simple prompt of \"Write a story about [character]\" and then generates a plot by answering questions like \"What happens next?\" or \"What happened at that point?\"\\n2) Using LLMs for planning and decomposing complex tasks in medical diagnoses, such as \"Diagnose and treat a patient with [disease].\" The model uses the task as a prompt to generate relevant diagnostic questions and then uses machine learning techniques like clustering or graph analysis to decompose the problem.\\n3) Using LLMs for planning and decomposing complex tasks in music composition, such as \"Compose a melody that [feature]\" using a simple prompt of \"Create a [feature] for [melody]. Use your creativity to compose.\" The model uses machine learning techniques like generative adversarial networks (GANs) or auto-encoders to learn how to create new musical elements in response to the input melody.\\n4) Using LLMs for planning and decomposing complex tasks in autonomous driving, such as \"Driverless car: [state], take a sharp turn.\" The model uses a simple prompt of \"Take a sharp turn\" or \"Turn sharply,\" along with visual inputs like maps or sensors to plan a safe trajectory. The model uses reinforcement learning and deep learning techniques like deep neural networks to optimize the driver\\'s behavior in response to the prompts.\\n\\nDiscussion:\\nThe main theme of this case study is how LLMs can be used for task decomposition, which involves breaking down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable subgoals. This process is challenging and requires careful attention to human-like reasoning, but it can lead to more robust long-term planning. The case studies showcase different approaches using LLMs in various domains, including music composition, autonomous driving, medical diagnoses, and storytelling. While the models struggle at times with unforeseen errors or unexpected data, their flexibility and ability to adapt make them a valuable tool for long-term planning tasks.</s>'"
